Hey, Thanks for stopping by. If you're interested please check out my website at [https://ashwin.dev](https://ashwin.dev) or contact me at **me@ashwin.dev** if you need help with my projects.

I am a Computer Science Graduate Student at the [University of Illinis at Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/). Currently, the focus of my research lies at the intersection of Natural Language Programming (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, and Deep Learning (DL). I've spent the better part of the last couple of years working on Multilingual Language Understanding. Specifically on analyzing and evaluating multiple downstream tasks like Sentiment Analysis (SA), Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Question and Answering(Q&A) on fine-tuned multilingual BERT in code-switched and transliterated contexts using task-specific adapters.

I believe that Artificial General Intelligence would revolutionize how we live, think, and exist, for better or worse. These are exciting times to be alive, where one individual has the power to change the course of humankind. It's a matter of when not if!

Python is my preferred programming language for anything and everything, from developing and training Deep Learning models and creating a pixel-perfect website for myself to writing basic daily automation scripts. I can also code in Java, C++, Ruby, C#, and R.
