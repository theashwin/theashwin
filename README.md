Hey there, I'm Ashwin Patil. You can visit my personal blog at [ashwin.dev](https://ashwin.dev) or contact me at [me@ashwin.dev](mailto:me@ashwin.dev) if you need help with any of my projects.

I am a Data Engineer at Fetch, where I create event-driven, petabyte-scale real-time systems with single-digit microsecond latency for Machine Learning Recommender systems. This allows me to work with tools like AWS, Kubernets, Kafka, Kafka Connect, Flink, Airflow, DBT, and Snowflake, built on the Kappa architecture.

I completed my Master's in Computer Science with a specialization in Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Deep Learning from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. During my time there, I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant, advised by Prof. ChengXiang Zhai at the Text Information Management and Analysis Group (TIMAN).

Python is my preferred programming language for anything and everything, from developing and training deep learning models and creating a pixel-perfect website for myself to writing basic daily automation scripts. I can also code in Java, Go, C++, Ruby, C, and Javascript.

Currently, the focus of my research lies at the intersection of Natural Language Programming (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), Scalable Systems, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, and Deep Learning (DL). Basically, this a messy intersection of buzz words and cool stuff. This is where I operate.
